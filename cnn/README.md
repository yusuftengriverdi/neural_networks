Investigation of Cats &amp; Dogs classical distinguish application of NNs with CNN. Framework is PyTorch. 

Credits to video-blog tutorial series, which started me to understand both pytorch & nns https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-neural-network-pytorch/. Starter kick scripts from this video-blog.

Dataset, that I work on it, is from Kaggle Contest. https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/E/1/3E1C3F21-ECDB-4869-8368-6DEBA77B919F/kagglecatsanddogs_3367a.zip.
