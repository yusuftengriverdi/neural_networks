# neural_networks
Investigation of Cats &amp; Dogs classical distinguish application of NNs with CNN and U-net. Framework is PyTorch. 

Credits to video-blog tutorial series, which started me to understand both pytorch & nns https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-neural-network-pytorch/. Starter kick scripts from this video-blog.

Then, I started with U-net.

IAlso, I tried k-fold-cross-validation with CNN.
